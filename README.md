# Algorithms and Data Structures in C# .NET

This repository covers the implementation (from scratch) of the following Data Structures and Algorithms:

### Algorithms:
- Recursion;
- Search:
    - Linear;
    - Binary;
- Sort:
    - Bubble;
    - Selection;
    - Insertion;
    - Merge;
    - Quick;
    - Radix;

### Data Structures:
- Linked lists (singly/doubly);
- Stacks;
- Queues;
- Trees:
    - Generic Trees;
    - Binary Tree;
    - Binary Search Trees;
    - Tree Traversal:
        - Breadth First;
        - Depth First:
            - PreOrder;
            - PostOrder;
            - InOrder;
- Binary Heaps:
    - Priority Queues;
- Hash Tables;
- Graphs;
- Graph traversal;
- Dijkstra's Algo;

### Why?
Most of the structures here are ready-to-use within .NET Framework and you can easily find them over the internet. The goal of this repository is to study in depth these algorithms and data structures to refresh the concepts of some and learn others. To do that, I took [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/) course from [Colt Steele](https://www.youtube.com/c/ColtSteeleCode), and studied the code and concepts presented in [Algoritmos e Estruturas de Dados, Parte II](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyWMN_0g3BQ) and [Algoritmos e Estruturas de Dados, Parte III](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GdesxWtOgs) from Fabio Akita, and translated them from C/C++ and Javascript to C#, which is my main language.

### Upcoming
The list of algos and DS need to be expanded, some important implementations (for example, Red Black Trees, AVL Trees). So I'll be adding more in a near future.
